# DEPRECATED: Travis CI Configuration

**⚠️ This file is deprecated. This project now uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD.**

This Travis CI configuration file is kept for backward compatibility with existing projects that were forked from this starter before the GitHub Actions migration.

**For new projects, please use the GitHub Actions workflows in `.github/workflows/` instead.**

See the [GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) for more information on migrating from Travis CI.
