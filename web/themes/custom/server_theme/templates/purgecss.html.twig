{#This is a Dummy twig file, with the sole purpose of holding class names
we are using, so they will not be purged by TailWind's purge CSS when we deoply.

The way CSS purge works is by going over the twig/theme functions and look for
the class names. If it will see in twig `bg-{{color}}` it will not pick it up,
as it doesn't know to what it will comiple.

Below are the custom colors we defined in tailwind.config.js
#}

bg-purple-primary
bg-turquoise

border-purple-primary
border-turquoise

text-purple-primary
text-turquoise
