1,"Current Digital Marketing Is Sports-Watching, Rather Than Marketing",1,"<p>Who doesn't like watching thrilling football games on Sundays (U.S.) or soccer, cricket, rugby, or pretty much every other kind of sport (Rest of World)? Watching sports has always been a favorite, lazy pastime; never more so than now.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Should digital marketing be a spectator sport, like watching sports? No. But sadly, most of the digital marketing we are doing right now is just that — watching sports and big numbers on dashboards — and we need to change that and get back to doing real marketing.&nbsp;</p>  <p>I'm not making any sense?&nbsp; I get that a lot.&nbsp; Let me explain.&nbsp;</p> ","1|4","f1cb6f28-67e5-4fbd-afd3-9d4a470c5d45","Sand dunes"
2,"Pandemic Moves Education Online",2,"<p>""Colleges and universities were clear that they needed support with digital materials and training for teaching in online and hybrid formats, and partnerships have been key in these challenging times,"" said Fernando Bleichmar, EVP and General Manager for U.S. Higher Education at Cengage. ""We've been able to help schools bridge the online learning gap with quality digital materials, services, and faculty and administrator training from leading online learning experts to build a better learning experience.""</p>  <p>As the pandemic closed campuses, higher ed leaders turned to Cengage Unlimited for Institutions for affordable access to quality, digital learning materials at scale, as well as academic services to move courses online and professional development resources to help faculty teach online. Partnering with Online Learning Consortium, Cengage offers bootcamps, office hours and customized trainings for Institutional customers.</p>  <p>Partnerships have grown by 50 percent since April, and more than 125 institutions now partner directly with Cengage to offer Cengage Unlimited at scale.</p>  <p>One of those institutions is Ivy Tech Community College in Indiana, one of the largest community college systems in the country with 90,000 students. Ivy Tech used funding allocated to the institution under the CARES Act to provide students with Cengage materials, and access academic services and professional development support for instructors.</p> ","2|4","01227a56-c95e-46c7-9955-72ea77a935fa","Skyline"
3,"Worrying Study Finds Today's Tutorial Levels Not Adequately Preparing Players For Challenges Of World 8",1,"<p>Offering a bleak assessment of gamers' readiness for the future, a concerning study from Harvard University released Thursday found that today's tutorial levels are not adequately preparing players for the challenges of World 8. ""Our data have shown that despite completing the requisite time in practice stages, the current crop of gamers simply does not possess the skills necessary to defeat enemies, collect coins, and level up as they go out into World 8,"" said lead researcher Michelle Gideon, telling reporters that a jaw-dropping 79% of tutorial levels failed to teach basic abilities such as crafting items and upgrading weapons that are crucial after finishing the Ice World. ""What's worse is that these tutorials often give players the illusion of preparedness, which leads to feelings of demoralization when they are then left to fend for themselves without any hint blocks or pop-up screens to help them. Sometimes, things can get so bad that they'll even just give up playing the game entirely."" Gideon added that the research highlighted significant economic disparity as well, as wealthier gamers could afford the DLCs and in-game purchases needed to reach the boss's castle.</p> ",3,"c62a7833-3552-4bde-b7dc-a716f14c6dce","An onion"
4,"Blind Texts",2,"<p>Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.

She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a copy.</p>  <p>The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin would be the word ""and"" and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return to its own, safe country. But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been rewritten, then they are still using her.</p>  <p>Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts.

You strive to exercise and call your friends more, and spend less?</p>  <p>You are not alone. New Year’s resolutions are as ubiquitous as they are difficult to keep.
