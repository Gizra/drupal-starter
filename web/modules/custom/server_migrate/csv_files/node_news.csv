news_1,"Current Digital Marketing Is Sports-Watching, Rather Than Marketing",1,"<p>Who doesn't like watching thrilling football games on Sundays (U.S.) or soccer, cricket, rugby, or pretty much every other kind of sport (Rest of World)? Watching sports has always been a favorite, lazy pastime; never more so than now.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Should digital marketing be a spectator sport, like watching sports? No. But sadly, most of the digital marketing we are doing right now is just that — watching sports and big numbers on dashboards — and we need to change that and get back to doing real marketing.&nbsp;</p>  <p>I'm not making any sense?&nbsp; I get that a lot.&nbsp; Let me explain.&nbsp;</p> ","1|4",image_1,"Sand dunes"

""We've been able to help schools bridge the online learning gap with quality digital materials, services, and faculty and administrator training from leading online learning experts to build a better learning experience.""</p>  <p>As the pandemic closed campuses, higher ed leaders turned to Cengage Unlimited for Institutions for affordable access to quality, digital learning materials at scale, as well as academic services to move courses online and professional development resources to help faculty teach online.

news_3,"Worrying Study Finds Today's Tutorial Levels Not Adequately Preparing Players For Challenges Of World 8",1,"<p>Offering a bleak assessment of gamers' readiness for the future, a concerning study from Harvard University released Thursday found that today's tutorial levels are not adequately preparing players for the challenges of World 8. ""Our data have shown that despite completing the requisite time in practice stages, the current crop of gamers simply does not possess the skills necessary to defeat enemies, collect coins, and level up as they go out into World 8,"" said lead researcher Michelle Gideon, telling reporters that a jaw-dropping 79% of tutorial levels failed to teach basic abilities such as crafting items and upgrading weapons that are crucial after finishing the Ice World. ""What's worse is that these tutorials often give players the illusion of preparedness, which leads to feelings of demoralization when they are then left to fend for themselves without any hint blocks or pop-up screens to help them. Sometimes, things can get so bad that they'll even just give up playing the game entirely."" Gideon added that the research highlighted significant economic disparity as well, as wealthier gamers could afford the DLCs and in-game purchases needed to reach the boss's castle.</p> ",3,"random_photo","An onion"

But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for their projects again and again.
